# TIN Validation with COBOL

The above program was developed for educational purposes in a seminar about Banking Consulting and is used to check the validity of a given TIN (Tax Identification Number)
in Greece through an input on the console. It prints special error messages when the TIN is invalid for various reasons and a valid message if the TIN is valid.

The programa was compiled and run on OpenCobolIDE v4.7.1.
